<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For David Miller, nations and state are necessary to each others’ conceptions. “<em>Nation&#8217; must refer to a community of people with an aspiration to  be politically self-determining, and &#8216;state&#8217; must refer to the set of political institutions that they may aspire to possess for themselves</em>.”<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Put differently, the way in which people govern (e.g., state) can only be applied to themselves (e.g., co-nationals); and for a nation to be recognised as one, it has to show its ability to self-determinate. Thus, in Miller’s conception, the notions of nation and state are mutually dependent.</p>
<p>Miller’s conception of the nation-state is problematic for the state can dominate over a nation. As the state possess coercive power, those do not identify themselves as a part of the nation, for example, are still subjected to the control of the state. To be sure, Miller rejects that states can be used to “<em>imposed national culture on people who may resist it</em>.” <sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Nonetheless, the necessity of a functioning state in a nation ground many possibilities of such violation towards one’s even if the state is not permitted to do so on a normative level.</p>
<p>State control is effective, and this can be a reason for one to join a particular nation. But the effective state is no reason to assume that it is <em>necessarily</em> the only source in which co-nationals can self-determinate. The claim that nation and state are mutually dependent might mean that these two elements are sufficient to the development of each other, but it does not follow from logic that a state is <em>required</em>. In many cases, people do not, or are in no position to choose their state. If the notion of national self-determination means the collective of individual self-determination<sup><a id="ffn3" href="#fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, with culture more likely to be chosen (and state-less so) by an individual, a true notion of national self-determination should take more seriously the notions that co-nationals can genuinely, and reasonably self-determinate.</p>
<p>This essay argues that a nation, on its own, can be self-determinating without the need of a deliberate agency such as the state. For Miller, the state is one of three propositions embodied by a nation. I argue that the state is not necessary for a nation. My argument rests largely on a cultural aspect of a nation: that co-nationals share a largely similar (if not the same) culture. A shared culture, I believe, can generate sufficient normative force for the purpose of social solidarity that help encouraging national self-determination. From the analyses of Brian Barry, Samuel Scheffler, and Seyla Benhabib, I argue that the grounding of culture is a more sensible ideal comparing to Miller’s <em>political</em> proposition.</p>
<p>This essay will proceed in three parts: firstly, I shall debunk Miller’s argument and his foundation of the <em>political</em> proposition, and argue that people’s self-determination need not entail a necessary stablishment of a state; Secondly, I examine the arguments of Brian Barry and Benhabib, and sketch a plausible cultural proposition in place of Miller’s original <em>political</em> proposition; Thirdly, I turn to Samuel Scheffler’s account on culture and tradition, and argue for a plausible basic normative framework within culture that does not require external interference such as the state. Before the end, I respond to Scheffler’s  objections to my proposal.</p>
<h2>Nation-State in Miller</h2>
<p>Nationality encompasses three propositions: 1) <em>Identity</em>, 2) <em>Ethical</em> <em>Community</em> (EC), and 3) <em>Political</em>. Identity “<em>claims that it may properly be part of someone’s identity that they belong to this or that national groups.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn4" href="#fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. Identity need not be constitutive of one’s personal identity <sup><a id="ffn5" href="#fn5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, what is sufficient is his subjective knowledge: e.g., he <em>feels</em> that belongs to this nation, rather than another. EC states that <em>nations are ethical communities</em>”<sup><a id="ffn6" href="#fn6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>, meaning that “<em>proper account of ethics should give weight to national boundaries</em>”<sup><a id="ffn7" href="#fn7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>. Importantly, EC does <em>not</em> mean no moral obligation to those from outside of the country, rather, it merely means that our duties toward those in our national territory are weightier. <em>Political</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“<em>…states that people who form a national community in a particular territory have a good claim to political self-determination; there ought to be put in place an institutional structure that enables them to decide collectively matters that concern primarily their own community.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn8" href="#fn8" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>For Miller, <em>Political</em> does not mean that an institutional approach is the only way to illustrate national self-determination<sup><a id="ffn9" href="#fn9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>. Following Miller’s definition, I call the institution(s) in which nationals self-determinate as a state<sup><a id="ffn10" href="#fn10" class="footnote">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the conception of state tells us very little about its relationship with its members. What we know from Miller is that a state is important for national self-determination, it is one of the propositions of nationality. And as far as people reach a genuine collective decision to construct a state, <em>per se</em>, this seems reasonable<sup><a id="ffn11" href="#fn11" class="footnote">11</a></sup>. However, it seems bizarre if people, through no fault of their own, become and, more importantly, remain subjects to a state (that they did not participate in deliberating its construction). Two distinctions can be made about people in this situation: <em>compliant</em>, and <em>non-compliant</em>. Compliant refers to those who choose to abide by the state. For example, people that are born after the establishment of the state’s basic structure have less power to deliberate in politics than their predecessors (who are responsible for the creation of such state). The point here is that the constraints on their liberty is not imposed by themselves<sup><a id="ffn12" href="#fn12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>. <em>This is hardly self-determining.</em> On the other hand, non-compliance refers to those refuse to abide by the state. In both cases, the existing state does not reflect their self-determination. Compliant people abide by the state non-willingly<sup><a id="ffn13" href="#fn13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> while non-Compliant people unwillingly abide <em>some</em> of the state’s demands. If we take Miller’s <em>political</em> proposition seriously, it seems that we have to rule-out those that do not satisfy the <em>political</em> proposition as non-nationals. <em>This seems counter-intuitive, and again, not self-determining. </em></p>
<p>To help us see the problem more clearly, we might invoke the notion of consent. In both Compliant and non-Compliant, there is no (explicit) consent<sup><a id="ffn14" href="#fn14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>. Assuming that there is no explicit consent from co-nationals, one might turn to the tacit consent, that, in virtue of his nationality, the consent to be subjected to be govern is assumed by this state. However, this assertion is too quick, not many people (or perhaps no-one) is capable of <em>voluntarily</em> decide on their nationality. The debate on consent has a rich philosophical background and is still heavily entangled. But what is important here, in light of liberal ideals, is that we ought to honour individual choices to the best of our ability and according to justice<sup><a id="ffn15" href="#fn15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>. Notwithstanding the lack of consent we can get from co-nationals to the state, we <em>still</em> have weighty reasons to take seriously the decision that one has in his culture that he reasonably deliberates.<sup><a id="ffn16" href="#fn16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Mere subjection to (bad) luck is no excuse for lack of rectification for future injustice.</p>
<p>Note, in making my argument, I do not reject Miller’s <em>political</em> presupposition but merely the necessity of which to ground national self-determination. I concede with Miller that self-determination is significant for a nation, even in cases where <em>not</em> everyone participates in the deliberative process of national self-determination. One can reasonably choose <em>not</em> to participate in deliberation process as his preferences differ from that of another due to the possession of different values<sup><a id="ffn17" href="#fn17" class="footnote">17</a></sup>. Nonetheless, my discussion above flags-up two points:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Political</em> can be <em>demanding</em>, as it concerns only those that are responsible for the constructing the state;<sup><a id="ffn18" href="#fn18" class="footnote">18</a></sup></li>
<li>Given the lack of consent, one’s subjection can only be trivially related to self-determination of his nation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, to establish nationality using self-determination, we require a stronger basis comparing to <em>Political</em> that takes more seriously one’s reasonable individual self-determination. In the next section, I shall outline what I call the cultural proposition, which seems to be a better way to capture, and honour people’s individual deliberation.</p>
<h2>Motivating a Cultural Proposition</h2>
<p>For David Miller, a cultural approach “…<em>pose(s) a problem for the principle of nationality</em>”<sup><a id="ffn19" href="#fn19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> for the vast amount of identities will dilute, or cloud that of the national one<sup><a id="ffn20" href="#fn20" class="footnote">20</a></sup>. National identities might collapse into ethnical identities<sup><a id="ffn21" href="#fn21" class="footnote">21</a></sup>. From a liberal perspective, the self-affirmed identity is not itself a problem for reflecting self-determination; instead, the problem lies with the different political connotation that each identity embodies.<sup><a id="ffn22" href="#fn22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> If one does not assign importance to his national identity, for example, his political ambition might be to serve the interests from his other identities, not necessarily for the sake of national self-determination. For example, a Christian who attributes importance <em>only</em> to his religious identity means that <em>all</em> of his political deliberation will be used only to serve his religion identity, giving attention to no other contexts. <sup><a id="ffn23" href="#fn23" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Before moving onto my arguments, it is important to bridge the gap between normativity and self-determination. In the following sections, I shall show, only, that culture can generate sufficient normative forces for people’s self-determination. Nonetheless, it might be argued that even if culture can be responsible for normativity that has certain demand on people’s action, it does not quite follow that self-determination is present in the process. I disagree. Certainly, no-one can be responsible for their background into which they are born, cultural or state. But this, on its own, is not a reason to assume that impossibility of self-determination <em>at all</em>, or the opposite-the <em>necessity</em> of self-determination<sup><a id="ffn24" href="#fn24" class="footnote">24</a></sup>. My arguments rest firmly on the cost of choosing alternatives. While it might be true that both culture and state are imposed onto people, and that all options embody certain non-voluntariness<sup><a id="ffn25" href="#fn25" class="footnote">25</a></sup>, it seems that the cost to choose another culture is much lower than opting-for another state. The cost is high in deliberating between states, partially because of the retribution that the state can impose on him (should one violate its regulation); while this seems less so in the case of culture: culture is a more open arena in which people have more flexibility to express their beliefs. Even if one does not enjoy the culture which he is in (and is reluctant to change for some reasons), how he chooses to cope with the existing culture begs for his individual self-determination. <em>Self-determination is one’s response to normative demands imposed on him.</em> Cultural normativity does not equal to self-determination, but it is nevertheless a great way to prompt so. In any case, self-determination is more desperately needed when people are unsatisfactory about the normative demand imposed on them, and less so when there is none.  <em>Political</em> explicit rejects imposing a state onto co-nationals because the state <em>needs</em> to be the result of national self-determination. <em>But there is no guarantee</em>. In this case, it seems, the slight pressure from culture is more suited encouraging self-determination.</p>
<p>In this section, I construct an account that enables people’s self-determination to take place from the culture. I engage, firstly, with the liberal’s inability to value every culture equally as liberals; secondly, I show how a cultural approach need not assume a relativist standpoint; Finally, I shall sketch the possibility of how culture can encourage self-determination as it is necessarily distinctive. Together, these three points will clarify some common misunderstandings about the culture and establish how culture can be normative.</p>
<p>Firstly: Barry agrees with John Gray that if liberal value pluralism entails “<em>uncombinability and incommensurability of values</em>,” then, “<em>neither liberal rights nor the democratic objects have any special status.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn26" href="#fn26" class="footnote">26</a></sup>. More importantly, for Barry, this statement <em>not only</em> means that we cannot utilise our judgements on the values not of our own; but it also <em>cannot</em> resort to claiming that <em>no</em> position is better/worse, for this inevitably invoke a comparative analysis that <em>fundamentally contradicts with the liberal ideology</em>.<sup><a id="ffn27" href="#fn27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> Put simply, not only can liberals not value every culture as equals, but also that liberals cannot value any culture at all<sup><a id="ffn28" href="#fn28" class="footnote">28</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Secondly: many find cultural argument cyclical, that, the value of certain things can only be rightly perceived in particular cultural context; this makes criticism very difficult (if not impossible). Indeed, it <em>seems</em> that “<em>the appeal to ‘culture’ constitutes some sort of justification in and of itself</em>.”<sup><a id="ffn29" href="#fn29" class="footnote">29</a></sup>.  Indeed, it is usually claimed by cultural relativist’s that “<em>this is the way we do things here.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn30" href="#fn30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> However, Barry argues against Taylor’s notion and claim that “…<em>we do things that way here not because it is a part of our culture but because it is the right thing to do</em>.”<sup><a id="ffn31" href="#fn31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> He believes that our value judgement is of importance <em>only</em> because of the social context that we are in, “<em>(i)n a liberal society, there would be nothing award in imposing liberal norm and protecting Rushdie from death threats; but in another society there would…be nothing awkward in executing him.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn32" href="#fn32" class="footnote">32</a></sup>. Thus, the fact that culture normally carries a relativist connotation is defused by Barry, for he believes that different cultures have different weights in values. That a culture finds certain value important does not mean that other culture, necessarily, cannot concede so. It could, however, mean that the culture does not subscribe the same level of importance to this very value, comparing to one that does. For example, murdering is wrong in a context because it violates one’s right to life; in a cultural context where the notion of human right is less weighty, murdering is wrong for another reason (e.g., that it arbitrarily terminate one’s life for the purpose of only the murder’s gain)<sup><a id="ffn33" href="#fn33" class="footnote">33</a></sup>. In both cases, we find murdering wrong. But the reason for thinking so differs drastically from one culture to the next. Thus, even if it is said that cultures sometimes resort to the internal justification of reasons for action, this, itself, does <em>not</em> mean that the outcome of deliberation of one culture <em>necessarily</em> differs to that of another culture.<sup><a id="ffn34" href="#fn34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> More importantly, cultural deliberation is not relativistic.</p>
<p>Finally, Benhabib believes that:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“<em>We should view human cultures as constant creations, recreations, and negotiations of imaginary boundaries between &#8220;we&#8221;&#8216; and the &#8220;other(s).&#8221; The &#8220;other&#8221; is always also within us and is one of us. A self is a self only because it distinguishes itself from a real, or more often than not imagined, &#8220;other.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn35" href="#fn35" class="footnote">35</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>To establish one’s identity, it is necessary for us to see what is distinctive of different people/groups. We require cultural dialogues to understand what is inherently distinct about us, comparing to other groups of people, “<em>’Complex cultural dialogue’ is not only a sociological reality but also an epistemological vantage point with methodological implications for social science and moral inquiry.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn36" href="#fn36" class="footnote">36</a></sup> We see the need to understand the notion of culture more fully (and refrain from resorting to philosophical reductionism) by mean of engaging in cultural dialogues because culture is embedded in different cultural discourses. If Benhabib is right: a clearer understanding towards any culture not only act as an explanation for <em>that</em> culture, but also help others to better understand their own cultures (e.g., liberalism). A culture, therefore, is of normative importance to <em>all</em> humans. When we disagree with practices in other cultures, our disagreement comes not only from our understanding of that culture but also the understanding of our own culture. From our culture, we generate value judgements; while quite possibly, we can also examine the normativity of our culture. All can achieve without invoking the illiberal better/worse judgement about another culture, or the judgment on the <em>value</em> of any culture. Co-nationals in this case self-determinate by looking at the differences between different cultures and choose what is the better for them. However, the reason for doing so is not because how another culture is superior/worse than theirs, but simply because this is right for their own culture.</p>
<h2>How can Culture be Sufficiently Normative?</h2>
<p>Thus far, I showed that culture could carry certain normative force which facilitates our self-determination. But this does not mean that the force is sufficient (such that we can withdraw the need for a state). This section shows how the culture’s normative force could be sufficient in virtue of basing on a tradition.</p>
<p>According to Samuel Scheffler, the reasons in support of tradition are normative<sup><a id="ffn37" href="#fn37" class="footnote">37</a></sup>. “<em>To subscribe to or participate in a tradition just is to see the fact that it calls for certain actions as reasons for performing those actions.</em>“<sup><a id="ffn38" href="#fn38" class="footnote">38</a></sup> He provides seven reasons with which we value tradition<sup><a id="ffn39" href="#fn39" class="footnote">39</a></sup>: “<em>convention, habit, wisdom, guidance, value, loyalty, and integrity</em>.”<sup><a id="ffn40" href="#fn40" class="footnote">40</a></sup>. For him, tradition fulfils the same functions <em>per</em> personal routines, from which we benefit highly. Personal routine is important as it serves three purposes: 1) compensate for the lack of control over our temporal mobility<sup><a id="ffn41" href="#fn41" class="footnote">41</a></sup>, 2) domesticate time<sup><a id="ffn42" href="#fn42" class="footnote">42</a></sup>, and 3) confirm our reality as temporally extended beings<sup><a id="ffn43" href="#fn43" class="footnote">43</a></sup>. Thus, tradition is important for us as a source of familiarity in the estranged and inevitable future.</p>
<p>Also, tradition is also important as <em>many people wish to feel a part of something larger than themselves</em>.”<sup><a id="ffn44" href="#fn44" class="footnote">44</a></sup>. If this is the case, then, for Scheffler, we need to account for reasons why 1) people care for themselves (or, our group) and 2) people identify ourselves with the current group but not others<sup><a id="ffn45" href="#fn45" class="footnote">45</a></sup>. For Scheffler, that people care about something larger than ourselves <em>naturally</em> extends beyond one’s life<sup><a id="ffn46" href="#fn46" class="footnote">46</a></sup>, “<em>for traditions are repositories of value, and are themselves objects of value, and the wholee point of a tradition is perpetuate the survival of what people value: to hand these values down from generation to generation.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn47" href="#fn47" class="footnote">47</a></sup>. In other words, tradition is timeless, in the sense that, <em>if</em> tradition decays, it is <em>not</em> because of the currently uncontrollable/unstoppable lapses of time but because of the deliberate choice of all generations of people that embody it. A tradition that is active in any generation is a crystallisation of everything that has happened to it in generations prior to this one; with elements that are most valuable being condensed and purified, and elements that are problematic discarded, or altered. Thus, modification of the tradition by any generation is <em>reasonable</em> and <em>meticulous</em>. Tradition modification is reasonable for it compares and contrast with other competing values active in the current generation; it is meticulous because the tradition is cared for by all the previous generations, as such, it is important for any change to reflect most genuinely of the tradition for the future generation. Tradition, then, is perhaps the most important source of normativity for culture. Any generation of people choose how, and to what extent they prefer to adopt the tradition. As suggested, all participation in tradition carries profound influence for the current peoples as well as for the future generations inheriting the tradition. Now, if tradition forms a part of a culture, it seems that we have a very solid ground on which we may find that culture is <em>sufficiently</em> normative.</p>
<h2>Objection</h2>
<p>For Scheffler, tradition differs from culture<sup><a id="ffn48" href="#fn48" class="footnote">48</a></sup>, as the reasons in support for culture are not normative<sup><a id="ffn49" href="#fn49" class="footnote">49</a></sup>. In addition, culture differs from moral, religion, and philosophical convictions for it is “<em>not in the same sense sources of normative authority, for they are not explicitly justificatory structures at all.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn50" href="#fn50" class="footnote">50</a></sup> There are two reasons contributing to Scheffler’s understanding:</p>
<ol>
<li>“<em>Culture does not have a uniform normative outlook, and many cultures exhibit a high degree of moral, religious, and philosophical diversity.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn51" href="#fn51" class="footnote">51</a></sup>;</li>
<li>Culture norms and values are descriptive, rather than normative: “<em>…to classify something as a cultural norm or value is not to characterise its perceived authority but merely to indicate that a certain group of people subscribes to it.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn52" href="#fn52" class="footnote">52</a></sup>;</li>
</ol>
<p>For him, that cultural reasons are not considered as normative reason is because they “<em>do not constitute a special class of norm- or value-based considerations over and above the various norm- and value-based considerations that agents already recognise.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn53" href="#fn53" class="footnote">53</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall respond to these points here. Firstly, I see no reason to assume that culture requires “<em>uniform normative outlook</em>”<sup><a id="ffn54" href="#fn54" class="footnote">54</a></sup> for the difference between culture is <em>precisely</em> that they are not uniform. In some cultures, the emphasis on religion is more; while in others, perhaps more so on ethnicity. There is no right or wrong way to view a culture; this is because, by judging so, this person already conforms to a set of values with the weight of which offered by his culture. Drawing from Barry, what culture provides is not the definitive answer of what our values ought to be; rather, it is the weight of different types of values. This does not entail 1) that a culture <em>necessarily</em> overlooks a type of value (e.g., religious) without good explanation; or 2) that values, <em>per se</em>, are imposed onto individuals. Being a member of a liberal nation means that his value judgement (affected by the cultural context) is heavily influenced by certain liberal ideologies, but this need not be causally related that he <em>actually</em> believes in these liberal ideals; rather, it merely means that the nation’s influence over this individual: a particular weighted combination of different values, in fact, form the basis on which he can raise reasonable objections.</p>
<p>Secondly, I concede with Scheffler that culture is frequent in our discourse with the purpose of identification, but this is not the only purpose it serves. When one voluntarily identifies with a particular culture, he does so not because of, say, mere admiration; rather, he does so according to his sense of belonging. If this is the case, then, that one’s realisation of his culture belonging requires a comparative assessment of his own values and that of the host culture’s. More importantly, I believe, even in a case where one did not choose to opt-out from a particular culture requires his self-determination on the situation. For example, that one did not opt out a culture might still be a result of his deliberation: e.g., that being a part of <em>any</em> culture is better than not being a part of any culture. Being reasonable in the liberal state does not mean that one, necessarily, has to deliberate in <em>every</em> situation possible. Scheffler further writes, “<em>Cultures survive only by changing: by accumulating and interpreting and producing new ideas and experiences.</em> ”.<sup><a id="ffn55" href="#fn55" class="footnote">55</a></sup>. For him, it is a mistake to hold culture constant. However, Scheffler’s claim does not influence the claim of normativity for culture. In the contemporary world, where immigration is a common phenomenon across the globe, changes take place in not only the immigrants’ cultures but also that of the host country<sup><a id="ffn56" href="#fn56" class="footnote">56</a></sup>. However, after rejecting the strong preservation viewpoint by Scheffler himself<sup><a id="ffn57" href="#fn57" class="footnote">57</a></sup>, I see no space in which we can reasonably restrict or regulate on the extent to which a culture can change<sup><a id="ffn58" href="#fn58" class="footnote">58</a></sup>. One can reasonably value (and preserve) culture only instrumentally and not intrinsically. In this case, reasonable people value culture, for example, because it provides a sense of belonging, facilitates inter-personal relationships. That one values culture at all is itself a sufficient reason for him to self-determinate according to the normative demands imposed by this culture; this is consistent with a Heraclitean conception of culture<sup><a id="ffn59" href="#fn59" class="footnote">59</a></sup>. In any case, a Heraclitean conception of culture can still make normative demands to its people, but the demands are likely to be weak.</p>
<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>In this essay, I argue against Miller’s claim that a state is required for a nation as it grounds people’s need to self-determinate, his <em>political</em> proposition. To reach my position, it is sufficient to prove that people’s self-determination can be realised without the <em>a priori</em> state. I propose that we can realise people’s self-determination base on their national culture. If a culture is sufficiently normative, I believe, people’s self-determination <em>follows</em>  autonomously for it is required of the people to verify and/or reaffirm whether they, in fact, are part of such culture. Such verification, or reaffirmation, to me, seems to be a great example of self-determination. Such form of self-determination is by no means political, but it can nevertheless have political ramifications.</p>
<p>Miller’s <em>political</em> proposition is misleading as it presupposes people’s self-determination has to be political. I see no reason for such assertion. More importantly, his position is more problematic to hold owing to his liberal standpoint. I believe a better way to encourage self-determination is by mean of culture. A common concern for adapting a cultural approach for a liberal is that of relativism; this, I answered, by invoking Brian Barry’s ingenious work. In the third section of this essay, I complimented culture’s normativity with tradition. Due to the limit of this paper, I could only sprint through many pieces of rich philosophical work. But I shall hope, nonetheless, that I have offered another explanation to national self-determination that is less abrupt and less demanding.</p>

<li id="fn9">Miller, David. 2013. Citizenship and National Identity. John Wiley &amp; Sons, p.27  <a href="#ffn9"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn10">In a practical sense, rather than theoretical. A theoretical state, by Miller’s definition, does not entail an institutional design.  <a href="#ffn10"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn11">As it is what genuinely <em>determined</em> by the people.  <a href="#ffn11"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn12">Miller notes that “<em>If we could persuade people to discard ideas of nationality and to regard themselves simply as members of the human race, per haps with cultural affiliation to a particular group but nothing more than this, the world would be a freer and more peaceful place.</em>”On Nationality, op. cit., p.13 <a href="#ffn12"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn13">Non-willing here means that he is neither willing nor unwillingly. One example could be that he simply does not care (as much as he should) about the constraints imposed by the state. Constraints on liberty can be seen as decreased <em>negative</em> liberty (from interference). But if his exercise of liberty (positive) does not concern  his diminished negative liberty, it seems that the impact on his negative liberty due to the state is trivial. Note, here I use Berlin’s distinction of positive/negative liberty. See, “Two Conceptions of Liberty” in Berlin, Isaiah, Henry Hardy, and Ian Harris. 2002. Liberty. Oxford University Press, USA. <a href="#ffn13"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn14">Explicit consent contrast with tacit and hypothetical consent. Some argue that there can be no hypothetical consent. This essay is no place to settle the rich debate on the ethics of consent, and table hypothetical consent. See, e.g., Miller, Franklin. 2010. The Ethics of Consent. Oxford University Press, p. 19 (on tacit consent); p. 115 (on hypothetical consent).  <a href="#ffn14"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn15">Disapproving readers might think that my explanation here is too presumptuous. One might argue that liberal ideal should prioritise on righting the injustice created by non-arbitrary factors (e.g., nature)-that if one complain on his nationality, it is of priority for his complaint be dealt with. However, luck egalitarians argue that it is too demanding (if not impossible) to deal with all forms of luck, see, e.g.: Temkin, Larry S. 1993. Inequality. Oxford University Press. <a href="#ffn15"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn16">It might be argued that culture and states rest on a par, that they both are non-arbitrary imposed onto individuals (e.g., when they were born). I think that the withdraw from culture is much less costly (and plausible) comparing to that of state, and as such, more problematic if we don’t treat it seriously. I shall visit this point later.  <a href="#ffn16"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn17">Miller concedes that, owing to the difference in people’s preference and their reasonable non-participation, the best way for state operation is by mean of democracy. On Nationality, op. cit., p. 89.  <a href="#ffn17"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn18">People that are born after the establishment of a basic state, for example, might reasonably claim that they do not concede with the state. They might do so on the ground of, for example, lack of consent, lack of sufficient knowledge, and so on.  <a href="#ffn18"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>

<li id="fn23">It might be worthwhile to note that Miller’s theory of nationality is merely to explain and accommodate nationalism (rather than to persuade one into acquire it: p. 15), for he believes “nationalism is a phenomenon that we must simply accept as a fact of life.”, On Nationality, op. cit., p. 6 <a href="#ffn23"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn24">For one can reasonably choose to not participate in a deliberation. This, to me, is a form of self-determination overlook by Miller’s <em>Political</em> proposition.  <a href="#ffn24"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>

<li id="fn27">Claiming that no position is better/worse than another still require a comparison between this <em>hypothetical</em> position to an existing position.  <a href="#ffn27"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>

<li id="fn33">Note, this simplistic case does not assume the exclusivity in values (e.g., human rights). Perhaps, the second case could carry some weightiness from human rights reason. But the point here is that the human right violation is <em>not</em> the main reason why murder is wrong in this particular context.  <a href="#ffn33"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn34">Of course, it can well be argued, morally, that what is of <em>most</em> importance is to do things for the <em>right</em> reason. However, given that our reasoning stems from a particular context, it seems demanding to presuppose, from the on-set, that <em>any</em> particular form of reasoning is “superior” or, “universal”. Indeed, “(o)nly a misunderstanding of the nature of liberal principles could lead anyone to imagine that they cannot countenance the legal enforcement of conventional norms.”.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this essay, I offer a <em>shareholder</em> approach to complement Mazor’s theory on intergenerational justice. <em>Shareholder</em> revitalises Mazor’s chain model by enabling a direct response to Parfit’s Non-Identity Problem; it also overcomes the contingency problem that I identify in Mazor’s theory. Finally, I shall show how the <em>shareholder</em> differs from conventional entitlement theory.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many find intuitive that the current generation (e.g., we) have obligations toward future generations. However, theories such as the non-identity (NID) wields away much force in transcribing our moral intuition into obligations. For Parfit, NID says there is no promise that this agent (to whom we owe our obligations) will <em>necessarily</em> exist<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup><sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>; therefore, we cannot identify, exactly, to whom we owe our obligations. Joseph Mazor responses to NID. His theoretical foundation is what we might call a “<em>chain</em>”: <em>briefly</em>, that 1) an immediate future generation <em>necessarily</em> overlaps with its current generation along with 2) our obligations toward all currently existing people mean that the obligations owed to any future generation can be traced back to generations prior to it. Put differently, take three generation proceeding: A-B-C (earliest-latest, while A and C do not overlap), A owes obligations toward C because A owes obligations to B, and B to C; also because A necessarily overlaps with B, and B with C. One might, therefore, argue that Mazor’s theory overcomes the NID for A’s obligations toward C does not require the existence of any particular member of C to come into existence. I believe this is mistaken but can be dealt with.</p>
<p>This essay replies to Mazor’s proposal by offering a remedial approach to his theoretical foundation: shareholder. <em>Shareholder</em> says that for <em>any</em> individual claim to particular resource, it is possible <em>if and only if</em> there exists no further active competition to particular resource. I believe, <em>shareholder</em> conjoins with Mazor’s chain model is a highly plausible theory for intergenerational justice.</p>
<p>There are four sections in this essay. Firstly, I highlight how, exactly, is NID challenging for intergenerational theorists. Secondly, I debunk Mazor’s argument and show how the NID remains unchallenged, while the problem of contingency emerges. Thirdly, I layout the <em>shareholder</em> approach. Finally, I reply to challenges.</p>
<h2>Parfit’s Non-Identity Problem</h2>
<p>Following Parfit, I assume that future generation necessarily exists<sup><a id="ffn3" href="#fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, meaning that the NID is a <em>real</em> problem<sup><a id="ffn4" href="#fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. Unable to determine the identity of the future people means that their claims to resources are hardly weighty to guide existing people’s actions. To be sure, it is <em>not</em> that we cannot benefit people in the future; but that we cannot benefit any <em>particular</em> future person. More importantly, it is also possible to deny responsibilities for future people, in light of NID<sup><a id="ffn5" href="#fn5" class="footnote">5</a></sup><sup><a id="ffn6" href="#fn6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. Collectivising the claims of future generation<sup><a id="ffn7" href="#fn7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> is also disputable for Mazor<sup><a id="ffn8" href="#fn8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>. Intergenerational justice, therefore, ought to bind individuals rather than a generation. Finally, justice derived from people’s entitlement and rights are also problematic. Parfit believes that future people, once they exist, can reasonably reject what we have assume of the them. We assume that a premature mother’s child is necessarily worse-off, but this need not be what this child, <em>in fact</em>, concedes.<sup><a id="ffn9" href="#fn9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>
<h2>Mazor’s Chain</h2>
<p>Mazor’s argument proceeds in two steps: 1) equal-share-transfer obligation, then 2) generations have obligations to conserve resource for future generation. In this section, I will sketch Mazor’s argument before exposing its problems, these will cast lights onto theoretical improvements.</p>
<p>For Mazor, equal-share-transfer obligation says that once a person exists, all other existing people have a justice-based obligation to ensure that he receives an equal share of resources; such is a claim of entitlement. Mazor argues that one’s resource-entitlement is unaffected even when 1) a certain type of resource is depleted or 2) there is no unoccupied resource. Responding to NID, Mazor argues that people “<em>are being harmed once they exist by not being given equivalent resources.</em>”<sup><a id="ffn10" href="#fn10" class="footnote">10</a></sup>. He concedes that while, pre-existence, one cannot be harmed due to NID; but he is harmed if he does not receive equal resources once he come into existence. Put simply, NID tackles on <em>potential</em> harm, and Mazor dodges the NID as he charges on <em>current</em> harm<sup><a id="ffn11" href="#fn11" class="footnote">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Building on the equal-share-transfer obligation, the resource-conservation obligation, for Mazor, can be sufficiently grounded as a demand of justice, rather than mere obligation. When <em>Agnes</em> (in the current generation) fails to save sufficient resources for the future generation, <em>Anthony</em> (same generation as Agnes) ought to be held accountable. Importantly<sup><a id="ffn12" href="#fn12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>, that people co-exist in a generation means that they form a partnership in meeting the resource requirement of future generation; and when one refuses to comply (e.g., Agnes), this means that those who comply ought to bear more burden<sup><a id="ffn13" href="#fn13" class="footnote">13</a></sup>. To be sure, Agnes owes her obligations <em>not</em> toward future generation but simply to complying people in the current generation (e.g., Anthony) as their obligations are otherwise less burdensome to uphold had everyone complied<sup><a id="ffn14" href="#fn14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>. While it can be argued that the additional burden due to no direct fault of Anthony’s is too demanding for him<sup><a id="ffn15" href="#fn15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>, he is, nonetheless, <em>residually liable</em> for not being able to prevent the injustice from happening in the first place (e.g., of Agnes’s overconsumption)<sup><a id="ffn16" href="#fn16" class="footnote">16</a></sup><sup><a id="ffn17" href="#fn17" class="footnote">17</a></sup>. Thus, all are liable for under-providing resources for future generations once they exist.</p>
<p>I believe Mazor’s argument is persuasive to bind non-complying agents to certain valuable obligations (e.g., of conserving resources) even if one does not act in light of justice for future generations. However, even if Agnes eventually complies with the obligations toward Anthony, for me, she does so for the wrong reason. Agnes, unlike Anthony, is acting disingenuously towards future generation. Anthony’s ingenuous care for the future generation persuade him to pick up Agnes’s slack. Sure, slack-picking, say, when one is unaware of his obligations, is in many cases <em>helpful</em>. But it seems highly counterintuitive to claim that <em>every</em> slack-picking is equally morally weighty. Pushing other’s chair into a table when he has forgotten to do so in a cafe <em>might</em> help with conserving resources for future generation. Imagine that we have helped David who assigns much importance to chair-pushing, that, when he knows of the accident (of not having to pushed the chair in), he <em>drives</em> back so that he can push back his chair. Therefore, we help reducing his petrol consumption by helping with his chair-pushing. But this case may seem farfetched for intergenerational justice because our kind chair-pushing is not, primarily, due to our concern for the future generation; instead, we concern primarily with elements proximate to us (e.g., David). Even if our action, by chance, helps with a greater goal (e.g., welfare of future generation), it seems presumptuous to equate such action to one that has more direct bearing on the greater goal.<sup><a id="ffn18" href="#fn18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> I shall call this the <em>contingency</em> problem.</p>
<h2>Motivating the <em>Shareholder</em></h2>
<p>Thus far, we see Mazor’s proposal dodges NID, and that the contingency problem is real. I believe that the <em>shareholder</em> approach can remedy both problems. Further, as we shall see, the <em>shareholder</em> does not require one’s entitlement or rights.</p>
<p>Being a <em>shareholder</em> of resources means that <em>one acknowledges that he is only able to obtain particular resource due to the lack of additional competition that could otherwise exist</em> (e.g., due to new-borns). A miner is only possible to extract particular units of coal at a given time and space, <em>if and only if</em>, there exist no other miners mining this identical portion of coal. To be sure, <em>shareholder</em> differs from mere acquisition/consumption (that resource-consumption, entail a reduction in total available resource for others); but that it also charges on the idea that someone else will make use of the identical share of resources<sup><a id="ffn19" href="#fn19" class="footnote">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>shareholder</em> replies to:</p>
<ol>
<li>NID: that we have obligations to future generations <em>not</em> because of their entitlement to a certain/equal share of resources (whether they in fact exist or not); instead, it is because of the lack of competition that can otherwise make impossible for one to extract the particular portion of resources. Future person’s identity, therefore, is irrelevant for <em>shareholder</em>.</li>
<li>Contingency: acknowledging the chances in which we may be impossible to extract a particular resource means that the claim to resource-entitlement is groundless<sup><a id="ffn20" href="#fn20" class="footnote">20</a></sup>. <em>Shareholder</em> entails that our actions, <em>necessarily</em>, bear on the otherwise competing agents, whether they exist or not.</li>
<li>Entitlement/rights: that one <em>can</em> utilise particular resource is because his competitors have not done so; and nothing about this begs one’s entitlement/right. Competitors need not <em>necessarily</em> compete for the <em>this</em> particular resource, but the total supply of this resource: one’s extraction of coal depends on coal being available (free from <em>direct</em> competition); if total supply of coal reduces dramatically, then, competitors <em>will</em> <sup><a id="ffn21" href="#fn21" class="footnote">21</a></sup>directly compete. Individuals have reasons not to over-consume for his prospect, in light of future competition to be  as low as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, <em>shareholder</em>, <em>per se</em>, might be under-demanding to be action-guiding because it relies heavily on personal perceptions which are highly individualised: that one sees a fierce resource-competition does not make it true for other people. However, <em>reasonable</em> people should not find it difficult that if all over-consumes, not only it is more difficult for themselves to consume more in the future (as resource becomes more scarce); but also that they <em>mutually</em> deprive each others’ possibility of resource-consumption, yielding hostility between people, obstructing social cooperation.</p>
<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>In liberal societies, one can reasonably reject social cooperation temporarily. However, a complete rejection seems impossible, more so with increased competition (e.g., due to emerging future generation). What we learn from Mazor’s chain is that intergenerational justice obligations can be met even if other co-existing members do not comply. <em>Shareholder</em> overcomes both NID and contingency problem for people now have obligations not only towards themselves but also members that could constitute their competition. More importantly, the existence and the identity of such members are trivial for the <em>shareholder</em> approach, as long as we can envisage the future generation.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The pragmatism of Richard Rorty sparked much attention amongst philosophers. Rorty’s proposal is distinctive from many existing theories in philosophy as it does not require the presupposition (of the value) of truth. To be sure, Rorty rejects the notion of truth being a pre-determined conception that is waiting to be discovered by scientists and some philosophers<sup><a id="ffn1" class="footnote" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. For Rorty, the conventional understanding of truth is <em>made</em>, rather than <em>found</em>, and has “take(n) hold of the imagination of Europe.”<sup><a id="ffn2" class="footnote" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. A distinction between fact and the description of fact ought to be taken seriously. The notion of truth applies only to the language that humans have created, for example, the description of fact; while fact itself is independent from the descriptions that we ascribe. That is, only upon statements constructed by languages can we assess its truth values, but neither our assessment nor the statement itself relates to facts.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Rorty famously claims, “take care of freedom and truth will take care of itself”<sup><a id="ffn3" class="footnote" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>; this extrapolates his attitude towards truth. For Rorty, our deliberate pursuit of our truth is constrained by our language. What is ultimately important, for him, is what matters in reality. As truth, according to Rorty, is made by languages and by extension, its user; its social position, therefore, is much dictated by whom utters the statement.</p>
<p>Though insightful and interesting, I find the Rortian account to be indifferent <em>in type</em> compared to the Rawlsian notion of the non-ideal theory. For Rawls, the non-ideal theory</p>
<blockquote><p>“…asks how this long-term goal might be achieved, or worked toward, usually in gradual steps. It looks for policies and courses of action that are morally permissible and politically possible as well as likely to be effective… non-ideal theory presupposes that ideal theory is already on hand.”<sup><a id="ffn4" class="footnote" href="#fn4">4</a></sup><sup><a id="ffn5" class="footnote" href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>At this point, it might be argued that the Rawlsian conceptions are unjustifiably deterministic, e.g., that non-ideal theory relies on (the existence) the ideal theory (which determines what it means to be ideal). But, as this essay argues, such interpretation (though reasonable), is not necessary nor sufficient. Moreover, in another equally reasonable conception of the non-ideal theory, Rortian theory is a coherent example of non-ideal theories.</p>
<p>This essay proceeds in three steps. Firstly, I lay the groundwork by looking at the distinction between ideal/non-ideal theory according to Rawls and show how Rawls’s cannot escape from assumptions of truth. I explain how, for Rawls, is ideal integral to non-ideal. Then, I visit a free-standing non-ideal theory from Amartya Sen, which stands contrary to Rawls’s distinction. I show how Rorty’s theory<sup><a id="ffn6" class="footnote" href="#fn6">6</a></sup> does not align with either Rawls’s or Sen’s theories. Finally, I qualify my claim by looking at Laura Valentini’s three understandings of ideal/non-ideal theory and show Rorty’s theory encompasses characteristics from all distinct understandings qua Valentini’s. With three understandings taken altogether, I argue, Rorty’s theory is non-ideal in the Rawlsian sense as his theory leaves open for an ideal (e.g., Rawlsian).</p>
<h2>Ideal or Non-Ideal Theory?</h2>
<p>The distinction between ideal and non-ideal theory is attributed to John Rawls.</p>
<p>According to Rawls, ideal theory:</p>
<blockquote><p>“assumes strict compliance and works out the principles that characterise a well-ordered society under favourable circumstances”<sup><a id="ffn7" class="footnote" href="#fn7">7</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Recap on the definition of non-ideal theory, ideal theory, serves as a basis for non-ideal theory, as it already assumes that an ideal theory is “on-hand”<sup><a id="ffn8" class="footnote" href="#fn8">8</a></sup>. The ideal/non-ideal dissection between theories is by no means unproblematic<sup><a id="ffn9" class="footnote" href="#fn9">9</a></sup>. What is important for our discussion, however, is <em>not</em> so much whether the Rawlsian conception of ideal is, in fact, unproblematic. Rather, we examine whether Rawls’s ideal presupposes the any notion of truth.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to be clear about the Rawlsian strategy with <em>idealising</em> justice or, put plainly, the procedure in which does Rawls derive any ideal reasonably. One intuitive strategy is the Original Position (OP) and the Veil of Ignorance (VI) <sup><a id="ffn10" class="footnote" href="#fn10">10</a></sup>. Roughly, OP is a thought experiment that provokes us, behind the VI, what sort of system would we want to be born into. Here, the purpose of the VI is to: “exclude the knowledge of those contingencies which sets men at odds and allows them to be guided by their prejudices.”<sup><a id="ffn11" class="footnote" href="#fn11">11</a></sup>. Excluded knowledge, for example, includes one’s sex, race, and culture<sup><a id="ffn12" class="footnote" href="#fn12">12</a></sup>. For Rawls, a reasonable person will come to agree his two Principles of Justice (PJ) after deliberating in the OP<sup><a id="ffn13" class="footnote" href="#fn13">13</a></sup>, where the first principle is <em>lexically prior</em><sup><a id="ffn14" class="footnote" href="#fn14">14</a></sup> to the second. Here, we see Rawls’s focus on liberty and equality<sup><a id="ffn15" class="footnote" href="#fn15">15</a></sup>. Rawlsian theory also concerns the design of basic social institutions such that a just and stable<sup><a id="ffn16" class="footnote" href="#fn16">16</a></sup> society can be formed based on the PJs.</p>
<p>So far, I have yet to discuss “truth” in Rawlsian theories. Nonetheless, it does seem that Rawls takes much for granted (e.g., that reasonable people <em>necessarily</em> comply with PJ, and/or their compliance is, in fact, <em>strict</em>). For Rortians, it could be argued that Rawlsian theory <em>requires</em> presuppositions of truth. For example, it is unclear what Rawls mean by “reasonable”, and by extension, whether its conception (whatever it may be) is indeed shared by other members of society<sup><a id="ffn17" class="footnote" href="#fn17">17</a></sup>. We might, therefore, be tempted to argue that Rawls is question-begging or is implicitly assuming truth to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Rorty sees Rawls to be free from assuming a “‘philosophical foundations’ of liberalism”<sup><a id="ffn18" class="footnote" href="#fn18">18</a></sup> as Rawls claims to rejects a conception of justice “<em>not</em> being true to an order antecedent and given to us…”<sup><a id="ffn19" class="footnote" href="#fn19">19</a></sup>. To be sure, Rawls argues for procedural justice, the idea of which “is to design the social system so that the outcome is just whatever it happens to be, at least so long as it is within a certain range.”<sup><a id="ffn20" class="footnote" href="#fn20">20</a></sup> He distinguishes between perfect and imperfect procedural justice, where perfect justice encapsulates 1) “an independent criterion…defined separately from and prior to the procedure which is to be followed”, and 2) that “it is possible to devise a procedure that is sure to give the desired outcome.”<sup><a id="ffn21" class="footnote" href="#fn21">21</a></sup>; while imperfect procedural justice captures 1), but not 2). Rawls’s attempt, however, seems to be unsatisfactory to bracket all contributing factors to the ranking of principles: for <em>any</em> criterion, however independent, still hinges on individual preference<sup><a id="ffn22" class="footnote" href="#fn22">22</a></sup>. In addition, that “certain range” does not provide enough information can give rise to some pre-existing intuitions and values (e.g., truth) from people. If I am correct, then, procedural justice may still contain values that are arbitrary (e.g., truth)<sup><a id="ffn23" class="footnote" href="#fn23">23</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One way to overcome these reservations about assumptions on truth is to discharge the notion of ideal, according to Sen,</p>
<blockquote><p>“A transcendental approach is neither necessary nor sufficient for answering questions on the advancement of justice that urgently demand our attention, which call for a robustly comparative approach.<em>”</em><sup><a id="ffn24" class="footnote" href="#fn24">24</a></sup>.<sup><a id="ffn25" class="footnote" href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>To clarify, a transcendental approach is not necessary as the mere existence of certain ideal does not entail people’s compliance, nor is it sufficient as it cannot guarantee a complete framework of justice<sup><a id="ffn26" class="footnote" href="#fn26">26</a></sup>. For Sen, a non-ideal theory is self-sufficient for we can rely on our intuitions while comparing between cases and judge which one is more just without requiring a pre-existing notion of justice. To tell which mountain is higher, knowing which mountain is the highest in the world (e.g., Mount Everest) does not help us to determine between the two mountains before us. Furthermore, we might add, a shared conception of “high” might not be necessary either, as long as we understand the criteria with which we are comparing against (e.g., height, rather than, say, width)<sup><a id="ffn27" class="footnote" href="#fn27">27</a></sup>. Sen’s non-ideal approach is alike act-utilitarianism where the decision to undertake any action rests on the judgment in every case (i.e., which action yields more utility/happiness). Act-utilitarianism stand in contrast with rule-utilitarianism where the preferred action is dictated by the rules (e.g., law). However, following act-utilitarianism might overlook the long-term benefits that we can otherwise preserve if we follow rule-utilitarianism. For example, speeding so that you can to the hospital early to see your injured family members trivialises traffic law for you; and when you break the traffic law more often, you are more likely to get harmed<sup><a id="ffn28" class="footnote" href="#fn28">28</a></sup>. Complying with rule, on the other hand, might yield great benefits in the long term at some cost in the short term.</p>
<p>However, elsewhere for Rorty, our reliance on moral intuition merely <em>asserts</em> rather than explain what is “good”. Also, what we might derive from philosophy or logic as “good”, need not comply with what is <em>in fact</em> good. <sup><a id="ffn29" class="footnote" href="#fn29">29</a></sup> Sen’s theory, as we have seen, relies heavily on our intuitions. Therefore, Sen’s proposal of a free-standing non-ideal theory is incompatible with Rortian theory. Nevertheless, what I have shown in this section, is that the Rortian theory is neither <em>ideal</em> in the Rawlsian sense, nor is it <em>non-ideal</em> in Sen’s sense, which stand opposite of Rawlsian theory.</p>
<h2>The In-Betweener</h2>
<p>In this section, I will explore if there is ground in-between the two extreme positions<sup><a id="ffn30" class="footnote" href="#fn30">30</a></sup> that is able to accommodate Rortian thoughts. For Valentini, the distinction between ideal/non-ideal theory could be understood in three ways, respectively: 1. Full-compliance v. Partial-compliance; 2. Utopian/Idealistic v. Realistic; and 3. End-state v. Transitional<sup><a id="ffn31" class="footnote" href="#fn31">31</a></sup>. What I will show in this section, is while Rorty does not exclusively commit to any of these categories; but following Valentini, Rorty is prone be understood as non-ideal because his theory encompasses non-ideal characteristics from <em>all</em> distinctions of non-ideal.</p>
<p>As we see previously, Rawlsian ideal theory assumes full/strict compliance. He believes that ideal theory is the ultimate values according to which we deal with social injustice. This perfectionist position is problematic, as I previously argued, as it can have footings on truth. For Rorty, that language is arbitrary makes the <em>nature of truth</em> (a formulation by language) a non-profitable topic for philosophical pursuit<sup><a id="ffn32" class="footnote" href="#fn32">32</a></sup>. Moreover, attempts to argue on the topic of nature requires language, that, as Rorty consistently argues, yield the process to be arbitrary. Recall, the physical existence of the world (e.g., fact), for Rorty, is independent of our description of it. The difference between Rawlsian and Rortian theory is that Rortian theory is not (at all) prescriptive<sup><a id="ffn33" class="footnote" href="#fn33">33</a></sup>. Put differently, for Rorty, people’s action is not determined by conceptions of justice agreed in society; people’s motivation for action, thus, is not prescribed by any conception of justice<sup><a id="ffn34" class="footnote" href="#fn34">34</a></sup>.<sup><a id="ffn35" class="footnote" href="#fn35">35</a></sup> However, Rorty’s theory <em>does</em> require partial compliance, as he “…urges us to think in terms of practices…”<sup><a id="ffn36" class="footnote" href="#fn36">36</a></sup>; even if a universalistic moral philosophy is impossible to be derived<sup><a id="ffn37" class="footnote" href="#fn37">37</a></sup>. That is, even though Rorty’s theory differs drastically from Rawls (namely of its lack of prescriptiveness), he nevertheless requires people’s attention be drawn, <em>necessarily</em>, to issues in practice; this yields Rorty’s theory partially compliant. In addition, Rorty’s exclusive focus on the reality affirms the component of <em>realistic</em> according to Valentini. However, we might, alike Rawlsian critics, question the extent to which Rorty’s theory is, <em>in fact</em>, considering all factors in reality<sup><a id="ffn38" class="footnote" href="#fn38">38</a></sup>. For example, in cases where people <em>genuinely</em> believe in a set of principles of justice that ought to be universally valid-should there be enough of these people-it seems that their principles ought to be taken seriously, regardless of its (lacking of) truth values. If Rorty’s concern is only in practice, then, he ought to take principles that people in reality <em>already</em> subscribe to seriously. This section concludes that Rorty’s theory is non-ideal in the first two of Valentini’s understandings.</p>
<p>Regarding Valentini’s third distinction, the Ideal/Non-Ideal distinction could also be seen as “end-state and ‘transnational”<sup><a id="ffn39" class="footnote" href="#fn39">39</a></sup>. What this means for non-ideal theory is that it “asks how this long-term goal might be achieved, or worked toward, usually in gradual steps”<sup><a id="ffn40" class="footnote" href="#fn40">40</a></sup>. In contrast, a theory is end-state when it specifies how a society can be <em>fully</em> just<sup><a id="ffn41" class="footnote" href="#fn41">41</a></sup>. While Valentini broadly agrees with Sen’s argument that a end-state theory of justice is neither sufficient nor necessary, she also notes from Simmons that without an ideal theory, we cannot tell whether a certain unexplored action is permissible, nor can we know what counts as success<sup><a id="ffn42" class="footnote" href="#fn42">42</a></sup> (for justice). Valentini’s two points on Simmons can be applied to Rorty’s theory. Indeed, Rorty’s deliberate rejection of notions of truth disqualify any sort of ideal (theory), other than, say, freedom. What this means for Rorty is that there is no way in which we can tell we are moving in the “right” direction for sake of justice<sup><a id="ffn43" class="footnote" href="#fn43">43</a></sup><sup><a id="ffn44" class="footnote" href="#fn44">44</a></sup>. Now, Rortians would undoubtedly dispute that any “right” way for justice, again, relies on certain notions of truth (as such, becomes unappealing). Nevertheless, that there is no way at all for us to review our progress by following Rorty is alarming. We <em>might</em>, for example, extend Rorty’s focus of freedom onto an ideal of its own, e.g., freedom-maximisation; and thus be able to assess our progress by seeing the extent to which we have achieved freedom (e.g., as a society). But this move cannot be taken by Rortians as mere consideration of freedom as an ideal violates freedom itself as it tampers with procedural neutrality (e.g., when people engage in conversations without pre-determined goals in mind). Nevertheless, as argued above, Rorty argues against the reliance on our intuitions in matters of political morality. Though unclear, we might see nevertheless see Rorty’s theory not as far as Sen’s, but still being close to Sen’s than Rawls; for both of these theories see Rawlsian ideal neither necessary nor sufficient.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is obviously arguable that <em>because</em> of Rorty’s rejection of pre-determined notions of truth that any attempts on mapping Rorty’s theory on the scale between ideal/non-ideal theory is futile. I disagree: while it is true that some philosophers take ideal for social justice to mean an exact collection of goods that we ought to pursue, there are many on-going disagreements with regard to, exactly, which type of goods is worthy of pursuit. Philosophers need not (and some have not, e.g., Rawls) take truth (and/or notions of) for granted; and by extension, formulate any theory of justice base on a particular conception of truth. An appeal to objectivism in moral theory need not entail any specific types of good (or pre-existing values including truth). Indeed, as Derek Parfit argues, utilitarianism, Scanlonian/Rawlsian Contractualism, and Kantianism could be combined into what he calls the Triple Theory (TT): “An act is wrong just when such acts are disallowed by some principle that is optimistic, uniquely universally willable, and not reasonably rejectable.”<sup><a id="ffn45" class="footnote" href="#fn45">45</a></sup>. TT appeals to more than mere people’s intuitions and necessarily provokes judgements that can yield conflicting outcomes, where to resolve them requires abandoning certain values of ours. That is, while it could be argued that TT still requires certain assessment based on people’s value, which might make it possible for people’s pre-existing values (including certain notions of truth that people subscribe to); but the mutually-conflicting nature of this trilemma is likely put all values under close scrutiny. In other words, <em>even if</em> people subscribe to certain notion of truth, their decision in their trilemma discharges pre-existing truths. I believe the TT consistently answers to Rorty’s worry on the arbitrariness of language; as some of our sensations, from, say, Kantianism, does not require language to aid our own understanding. Note, however, this essay is no place to ground Parfit’s TT. I merely invoke TT to show that a theory of morality is possible without relying on truth that exists prior to deliberation of any sort.</p>
<p>This essay argues that Rorty’s theory can be considered as an example of Rawlsian Non-Ideal theory. Firstly, I laid out two extreme positions in the ideal/non-ideal debate: Rawls and Sen’s. For Rawls, ideal theory serves as the basis for non-ideal, and specifies the contents of justice; while for Sen, ideal theory is neither sufficient nor necessary for a plausible account of non-ideal theory. As I showed in this essay, Rorty’s theory is neither of these positions. However, as I also showed, Rorty’s theory remarkably resembles characteristics of non-ideal theory from all three understandings of Valentini on non-ideal theories. As I argue Rorty’s theory cannot be Sen’s, this means that Rorty’s theory resides between Rawls’s ideal and Sen’s non-ideal theory. Before end, I also elicit a possible moral theory that can serve as an ideal for Rorty.</p>

<li id="fn8">To be sure, in the 2009 edition of <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, Rawls believes non-ideal theory “is worked out after an ideal conception of justice is chosen; only then do the parties ask which principles to adopt under less happy condition.” This definition, though similar, has no direct bearing on the ideal theory.

<li id="fn14">This, for Rawls, mean that we ought to “A principle does not come into play until those previous to it are either fully met or do not come into play until those previous to it are either fully met or do not apply.” A lexical ordering, for Rawls, means that we do not need to balance difference principle at any given time. <em>A Theory of Justice</em>. 1971. op. cit., 43 <a href="#ffn14"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>

<li id="fn25">For him, the transcendental approach to justice focuses “on identifying perfectly just societal arrangements”, which stand in contrast with “comparative approach (which) concentrate instead on ranking alternative societal arrangements, rather than focusing exclusively, or at-all-on the identification of a full just society.” Ibid., 216 <a href="#ffn25"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/21a9.png" alt="↩" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></li>
<li id="fn26">For example, a transcendental approach might merely provide us with guiding principles that can derive further principles that, taken altogether, be considered as a <em>complete system of justice</em>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sufficientarians believe that every citizen in a society should receive an adequate level of education. Educational adequacy, for sufficientarians is capped at the school level. It has attracted much attention and criticisms from other scholars, most notably, from the theorists of educational equality. In this paper, I strive to argue for a sufficientarian principle for <strong>higher</strong> education (HE), one that builds upon Satz’s educational adequacy. Though this paper, I find that the revised sufficientarian principle, is better and fairer than its predecessor. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Debra Satz believes that education ought to be interpreted in relation to equal citizenship<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>: One is entitled to an adequate level of education that a state provides if he is a citizen of this country. Her account is sufficientarian for she believes that <strong>every </strong>citizen should receive an adequate level of education, and it is <strong>sufficient</strong> for the government to ensure that everyone has received so.  Educational Adequacy (EA), thus, is non-comparative, for it does not depend upon the equality of resources between citizens, or equal development of children’s potential. In other words, so long as one is a citizen of a country, regardless of factors such as income, class, gender and so on (that might otherwise affect one’s access to education especially in a capitalistic society), everyone children should, at least, received the adequate level of education. </p>
<p>EA contrasts with other egalitarian positions, namely that of the educational Equality (EE). There are three types of EE, according to Satz: 1) nondiscrimination<sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>; 2) horizontal equity<sup><a id="ffn3" href="#fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>; and 3) vertical equity<sup><a id="ffn4" href="#fn4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>. Satz rejects these three types of EE on different grounds. Importantly, against the theorists of EE, she notes that the <em>equality of opportunity for talent development leads to inequality of opportunities in the development of the potentials of their children</em><sup><a id="ffn5" href="#fn5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. </p>
<p>EE is often known for its comparativeness: we access equality normally by seeing if others have received the same level of welfare to ourselves. EA contrasts with EE, for it does not require the comparison with other people. Non-comparativeness is perhaps what makes Satz’s proposal efficient, as it is more likely to provide policymakers with a clear guideline whilst also preserving some egalitarian spirits. </p>
<p>In light of Satz, I believe that higher education ought to be provided, in a similar fashion to EA. In this paper, I strive to argue for a sufficientarian principle for <strong>higher</strong> education (HE), one that builds upon Satz’s EA. The revision is simply by alleviating the current level of sufficiency in EA onto the level of HE. The revised principle of EA: EA’ preserves the key benefits of EA, while being responsive to some EE theorists. Practically, the demand for EA’ is most notable in more expenditure onto HE. The duty of the government is to devote an increased proportion of fundings onto HE. This, for the simplicity of the argument, will be assumed in the essay when I denote “support” or “subsidy”. </p>
<p>I shall proceed, firstly, by arguing the reasons why we should treat the HE more seriously by establishing firstly that, HE as a part of the education system serves the same aim as the school-system. Next, I argue that there the HE, different to school, deliver more values that are <strong>unique</strong> and <strong>distinctive</strong>. Contrary to that popular belief that the HE ought to be voluntary, I provide reasons why that it should be incorporated into a new principle of sufficiency. Later, I show that EA’ is a fairer principle than EA by engaging with egalitarian criticisms towards EA.</p>
<h2>Treating the HE More Seriously.</h2>
<p>For many, it might be odd to consider HE and education (in general) separable. Ordinarily, we are likely to think of the HE as the peak of one’s education career: quite often, whether one can successfully progress onto HE requires roughly two decades of personhood. For many people, it is significant for them to live a meaningful life. Since we are young, we are guided by people, and factors all around us to live a meaningful life<sup><a id="ffn6" href="#fn6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.  While the standard of <strong>meaningful</strong> differs from one to another, but education is a conventional way in which people rapidly develop themselves, acquire the skillsets they need to realise their own meaningful life<sup><a id="ffn7" href="#fn7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>. Education, thus, has remained a heated topic in the public domain, for any change in the provision of which can have drastic impacts on people’s abilities to achieve a meaningful life. Importantly,  more attentions are attributed to education at a younger age, quite plausibly, because the education proceeding is chronological: one typically proceed by following the Elementary-Secondary-Tertiary chain. If one develops positive attitudes, personalities and values towards their respective lives at a young age, then, the positives tend to reciprocate within his life.  The development, however, can be seen at any stage of the chain of education. Values are transferrable in many spheres of one’s life, whether it’s positive or negative. It is thus, crucial to develop positive values at the beginning, rather than the negative ones. For example, if one has the virtue of being humble since he is very young and continues to remain so in his life, then he is likely to be successful in education: he is more likely to be respected when raising a question, therefore he might be more likely to acquire new knowledge that he otherwise would unable to do so. </p>
<p>Much of scholarly research has been devoted to school-education. The devotion is justified, I think, <strong>only</strong> to the extent that education is a chronological proceeding. HE is often treated as the next-step of school-education. For Barnett, however, he thinks that universities and colleges (i.e. the higher education system) are <em>higher</em> for they enable students to take a view from <em>higher</em> above, from and of what they have learnt in school-education<sup><a id="ffn8" href="#fn8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>, he argues that the higher education stands out from other forms of education by apply a philosophical and historical account. John White, on the contrary, contents that there <em>is nothing higher about</em>  (the higher education), and we only refer to a higher administrative proceedings of education in the context of HE<sup><a id="ffn9" href="#fn9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>. The present paper is no place to debate on the linguistic usage of higher as in higher education. However, in philosophy and elsewhere, there is no consensus of whether should we be treating the HE as a superior form of education to, say, school-education. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, as an element of the education system, the HE has many common aims with others. For instance, Brighouse believes that there are four educational aims<sup><a id="ffn10" href="#fn10" class="footnote">10</a></sup>: </p>
<ol>
<li>Educating for Self-Government; </li>
<li>Educating for Economic Participation; </li>
<li>Education for Flourishing, and,</li>
<li>Creating Citizens. </li>
</ol>
<p>If Brighouse is correct, then as a part of educational proceeding, HE betters students, bearing these four aims. </p>
<p>However, there might be other <strong>unique values</strong> of HE. These values are further realised by students of HE, <strong>owing</strong> to the previous educational proceedings. These values are usually <strong>empowering</strong>, as they enable students to improve some of their values, and as such, empower themselves. One such example is diversity. Diversity is an important value of schooling because it  enables students from different societal background share communal experience of teaching. The emphasis on diversity is apparent, for example, in the work of Anderson<sup><a id="ffn11" href="#fn11" class="footnote">11</a></sup>, Satz<sup><a id="ffn12" href="#fn12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>. The HE, however, is able to put <em>more</em> emphasis on diversity<sup><a id="ffn13" href="#fn13" class="footnote">13</a></sup>. Another example of value that HE enhances is critical thinking, examples of which can be found in the work of Ebels-Duggan<sup><a id="ffn14" href="#fn14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>, Buchanan<sup><a id="ffn15" href="#fn15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>. </p>
<p>HE graduates tend to get a higher-paid job than school leavers, because HE is a place where students can focus more narrowly on few specialities. This, as said, empowers students. But, HE institutions tend to have access to more resources given its mandates in research, as well as teaching. Schools, on the other hand, tend to have less resources, as their primary goal is to teach, not research. In this case, HEs are more capable in giving financial aids to talented students from a deprived background, whilst schools inability to do so might result in forcing the student to enter a more affordable one, which has less educational resources<sup><a id="ffn16" href="#fn16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>. While egalitarians think differently about fairness, but one is being treated unfairly, if one is being refused equal opportunities due to no fault of his own. HE is <strong>rectifying</strong>, because it rectifies some unfairness, possibly, resulted from the school-system. </p>
<p>Appealing as they may be, unique values of HE in the senses of empowering and rectifying, joined by the typical values one receives from education-might still be insufficient to motion for increased support in HE. One might argue, of course, that one need not enrol the HE to enhance their skills<sup><a id="ffn17" href="#fn17" class="footnote">17</a></sup>. There are, of course, values that are only distinctive of HE. </p>
<h2>If the HE is Voluntary, Why Should We Subsidies it Anyways?</h2>
<p>The <strong>distinctive</strong> values of HE, refers to those that  can <strong>only</strong> be realised if one has been through it, <em>independent</em> of one’s school experiences. Brighouse argues that HE graduates are not only better off in terms of their increased income and enhanced life prospects; but they also get to <em>enjoy</em> university<sup><a id="ffn18" href="#fn18" class="footnote">18</a></sup>. In what he calls <em>self-exploration</em>, Brighouse believes that university is a great place for school graduates to undergo a process in which they are made to see their capacities, wishes more clearly. It is through the process of self-exploration, for Brighouse, one knows better what his interests are, and the plausibility of his goals. </p>
<p>One might disagree with Brighouse, for they think that process like the self-exploration can be achieved elsewhere. One can quit being a plumber if he does not feel like working for it.  Gutmann believes that learning for its own sake is important because <em>real-world goals cannot always be best achieved directly</em><sup><a id="ffn19" href="#fn19" class="footnote">19</a></sup>. For Gutmann, therefore, even if one can undergo an alike exploration process elsewhere, it is not for the love of studying that helped in exploration, rather, it is for a mean that is more direct, and more immediate (e.g. personal survival). Of course, this is not to argue that one’s survival is not important-it clearly is. But the benefit of deferred gratification<sup><a id="ffn20" href="#fn20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> is that <em>it</em> is greater than immediate gratification. Approaching difficult and not-straightforward issue is sometimes better to take a macro perspective, which can be partially granted by systematically studying for it. </p>
<p>One might persist into arguing against subsidising HE, as it is largely considered to be voluntary. White asserts three main differences between HE students and school students:</p>
<ol>
<li>HE students are no longer children<sup><a id="ffn21" href="#fn21" class="footnote">21</a></sup>;</li>
<li>HE students are <em>primordially the ones who decide what direction their learning will take</em>; </li>
<li>HE students chooses HE based on consumer preference<sup><a id="ffn22" href="#fn22" class="footnote">22</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think, however, these three points can be argued against easily: while one ought to be held accountable for wrongful voluntary action that he choose to undertake-it is undeniable that any human being can intend for the wrong purpose. But acting wrongly, even intentionally, does <em>not</em> amount to no support for rectification. Some clarification is needed: Dworkin distinguishes between <em>brute</em>(pure risk) and <em>option</em> luck (result of gamble)<sup><a id="ffn23" href="#fn23" class="footnote">23</a></sup>.  In our case, however, it is less clear. One chooses poorly on HE might be a negative effect because of the negative effects that he received from the school education system.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as a choice for HE is voluntary, we cannot ignore the fact that in some cases, schools can be perceived involuntary and demanding: In his remarks about school education, John White believes that the school system <em>looks highly counterproductive from the point of view of meaningfulness</em><sup><a id="ffn24" href="#fn24" class="footnote">24</a></sup>. </p>
<p>The school system is counterproductive, on one hand, due to the timetabling system. For White, <em>if students change after every 50 unites to a different academic subject, this would seem a hinderance to meaningfulness</em><sup><a id="ffn25" href="#fn25" class="footnote">25</a></sup>. Further, <em>[students’] day- to-day lives should become filled with increasingly complex pursuits of all sorts—not only academic ones—on which they can be enthusiastically engaged<sup><a id="ffn26" href="#fn26" class="footnote">26</a></sup></em>. Changes like these, not only interrupt students’ concentration; however, at times, they might even be interrupted whilst concentrating on the things that they are passionate about: <em>A regime like that can be expected to maximise their sense of involvement. Yet the actual regime to which they have to submit is one of changes of activity fixed by the bell and along a narrow gamut of traditional academic subjects</em><sup><a id="ffn27" href="#fn27" class="footnote">27</a></sup>. On the other hand, for White, a curriculum which focuses on a set of pre-determined subjects might worn-off students’ interests towards studying. In this case, students may feel that they have no option other than to study. As such, students would feel miserable, even though they might retrospectively appreciate the value of school education. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding White’s plausible thoughts, I think, the comprehensiveness in school-level education is demanding: one might still feel miserable, not only due to the contents that they are studying; but also due to the amount of subjects needed to formulate into, what White called,<em> ‘a rounded education’, or initiation into all the major branches of knowledge</em><sup><a id="ffn28" href="#fn28" class="footnote">28</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Finding school education unpleasing, whether about the content and/or the quantity of subjects needed to study need not demand reassessing the school-education system only to making it seem more appealing to students. In context of education, I think, there is some grounds for paternalism, simply because students might not have possessed sufficient knowledge to understand and so to judge what is best for them. We cannot, however, then, neglect the possible detrimental effect that the flaws in school systems might have on students. As said, students might, in the foreseeable future, come to the understanding of the meaning of school-education and the much needed paternalism behind it. Setting the adequacy level only at the school-level, however, may not incentives or, even disincentives students to go to universities. Some clarification is required: one does <strong>not incentivise</strong> if he remains neutral on the matter. One <strong>disincentivises</strong> if he actively withdraws incentives. Disincentivising one to go to university is clearly wrongful for it presuppose <em>arbitrarily</em> that HE is not worth attending. Whilst it may be less wrongful not to incentivise, I think, only if one can successfully remain neutral on HE, having laid out all <em>distinctive</em> features of HE. </p>
<h2>Towards a Sufficientarian Account of HE and Supporting the Principle of Fairness</h2>
<p>In their <em>critique of Anderson and Satz</em><sup><a id="ffn29" href="#fn29" class="footnote">29</a></sup>, Brighouse and Swift (BH) offered three very forceful responses to sufficientarians. In what remains of this paper, I aim to reply to these responses. </p>
<p>Firstly, BH believes that fairness is hostile towards the uncapped inequality, post-adequacy. It is true for sufficientarians, that government need not intervene further into inequality, provided that EA is achieved. The principle of fairness demands that inequality is only permissible if it benefits the worse-off. Thus, for BH, allowing the government to <em>not</em> intervene is unfair, for this takes away the <em>supposed</em> benefits under the principle of fairness.  EA’ can rectify this in two ways. First and foremost, incorporating HE into adequacy requires more resources. As such, more spending is required. Therefore, BH’s concern is lessened, at least in the short term. One immediate response would, perhaps, be regarding the beneficiaries of EA’, simply because not everyone will enter HE, eventually. Under EA’, however, students are not the only beneficiaries. the increase in HE enrolment entails the increase in HE graduates<sup><a id="ffn30" href="#fn30" class="footnote">30</a></sup>. What this implies, however, is that there might be more chances for benefiting school-level education. There will, for instance, be more teachers, administrators, or even, engineers, to help facilitating schools. If this is true, then, EA’ is more likely than EA to benefit the those with limited or no access to schools, <em>ceteris paribus</em>. People outside ordinary education can also be made better-off, for example: disabled people that require special education. If there are more graduates of HE, assuming the same proportionality of subject choices, then people outside ordinary education system can also be benefitted. EA’ is appealing for the additional <strong>reciprocity</strong>, granted by HE. </p>
<p>HE reciprocity has further implications in light of fairness, as well. In EA’, not only will prospective students be insured access to higher education (that they aspire); but will also benefit those that are not as determined to go enter the HE, by offering them more expertise. If Satz right about how education can provide one with the necessary skills to become a good citizen in a society, then, what the HE can provide, for instance, are skillsets (e.g. critical thinking<sup><a id="ffn31" href="#fn31" class="footnote">31</a></sup>, and qualities (e.g. humbleness, clarity<sup><a id="ffn32" href="#fn32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> that can better gear one towards his meaningful life. EA’ is fair, in light of meritocracy, as it provides abled students with more chances, and less abled students with a decent skillset so that they are better prepared for the future. </p>
<p>Secondly, BH think that the EA is also subject to the objection of leveling down, rightly made by sufficientarians. The leveling down objection in education, refers to the increased amount of resources needed to support disadvantaged students. This is unfair, for some, as it reduce the chances of the talented and abled to excel, by subjecting them to more difficulty. Under EA’, however, the force of this objection is significantly reduced. In EA, one is subject to leveling-down because the talented, and the abled, are given less resources; they might be less likely to proceed onto HE, or other means of post-education due to the decrease of their <em>supposed</em> amount of resources.  If everyone is given a chance to HE, leveling down is less apparent as more abled students are likely to enrol more prestigious universities; while less-abled students are still entitled to the benefits of HE. On the flip-side, with EA’, talented students from a more deprived background can also put their talents to use in HE. What is appealing, for EA’, is that it provides the most serious victims of leveling-down the minimum amount needed to flourish in society while also enabling others to pursue their aspirations fairly. </p>
<p>The third and final point made by BH against sufficientarians is that, under EA, integration (<em>sine qua non for the fullest achievement of adequacy <sup><a id="ffn33" href="#fn33" class="footnote">33</a></sup></em>) might be achieved quite unsuccessfully, as schools can be <em>defected</em> by the children of advantaged parents. In other words, students from a more deprived background might fail to integrate into the society. Thus, for BH, they find EA less attractive if the adequacy cannot be achieved fully, due to the failure of some students’ integration. </p>
<p>To clarify, BH never intent to overthrow theories of sufficientarian on this ground and/or other grounds. They believe that justice requires both equality and adequacy. In this case, at least, BH believes that it is not implausible to favour equality over adequacy. For them, full adequacy is demanding as it requires integration.  While they would not object to the values of integration, but egalitarians such as BH argue that justice might be achieved more effectively, at some case, if it is achieved using means of equality, rather than adequacy. </p>
<p>Under EA’, however, the dilemma between equality and adequacy might be better tackled, as it can be made less stringent on the school-level, as the emphasis on EA’ is on HE, rather than school-education. What implies, is that it can accommodate the diversity among HE students. I cannot take credit for this, as this is not new: HE nowadays are incredibly diverse (and it might become more so), welcoming students not only from different backgrounds from within a society, but also students from other societies, cultures, as well. If integration is a concern amongst philosophers, then, I think, HE institutions are better places to prepare students for diversity in society. </p>
<p>One can, persist to argue that, another form of segregation might arise due to EA’: the prestigious universities might become more concentrated with abled students. It is a form of secularisation, because students from a well-off backgrounds are more likely to enrol into prestigious universities. However, even if, statistically speaking, more students from middle class and above are likely to enter prestigious university, we cannot ignore the fact that HE institutions would also welcome those with extreme talents, regardless of his background. HE might, for example, provide this student with scholarship, living expenses, and so on, to ensure that he can participate in a very rewarding journey.  </p>
<p>Now, I shall provide some missing pieces from EA’ that I have yet to touch upon in previous sections, these tackle some other peripheral concerns that egalitarians might have. The EA’, more so than EA:</p>
<ol>
<li>Incentivises students whilst preserving necessary fair competition; One might reasonably argue that by making HE accessible to all, students might take HE for granted, causing inefficiency. The inefficient use of resources, in this case, could have been better deployed onto serving other goals, such as that of equality. I admit, there will be chances where students might not treat HE seriously. However, it is wrong, as a principle, to not take the HE seriously. One might not enjoy HE as much as others, but one cannot dismiss the values of his education, regardless of whether these values are personal, or not. As mentioned, I think, paternalism in education is much needed. EA’ incentivise more people into entering than EA; whilst, inequalities are significantly lessened. HE should not be treated as a separate career path comparing with other industries; rather, it should be treated quintessentially a form of education.  </li>
<li>Prepares students to become better citizens; For Satz, one important aim of education is to prepare the necessary citizenry skillsets to students. This includes an important threshold level of knowledge and competence. However, merely by knowing and understanding, for example, politicians, is not enough. It is significant as well, for one to be able to reflect on politicians’ messages. As said, even if one argues that skills such as critical thinking might be learned outside the institutions of the HE, but HE as a level of sufficiency can ensure that more people (for whom did not acquire the skillset necessary to participate in politics) than EA can be taught and trained to do so. </li>
<li>Tackles equality more easily; For egalitarians like BH, they might think that the mandate for sufficientarians is only to maximise benefits (e.g. societal and/or personal). EA principle might appear to be welfare-centric, as such, one may be tempted to say that EA’ is worse than EA in that it also place too much focus on welfare. However, this need not be the case: the EA treats HE completely voluntarily, as it considers school-level education sufficient. After leaving school, one may choose to become a plumber, as his wish. However, enrolling him on HE not only ensures more training and practise of skills, that one requires to be a better citizen; graduating from the HE also means that he is (relatively) equal to a lot of people in a society. In the UK, almost 50% of the population are educated on the tertiary level<sup><a id="ffn34" href="#fn34" class="footnote">34</a></sup>; 43.5% of <strong>adults</strong>(25-64 year-olds) are educated on the tertiary level. Ten years ago, however, only 35.54%<sup><a id="ffn35" href="#fn35" class="footnote">35</a></sup> of the  adult population have received tertiary education. With the growth rate of approximately 1% per year since ten years ago, I think, it is insufficient to cap the sufficiency at school-level. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, I hope to have shown that the EA’ is a better and fairer principle than the EA. The sufficientarian way, I think, is the best to promote education and the values it stand for. EA’ is, of course, highly ideal. It is incredibly demanding, most notably in its demand for additional resources to be contributed. However, I hope, through this essay, have provided a possibility that is both effective and reasonably fair. The efficiency of EA’, is granted by its strong foundation in the principle of sufficiency; whilst it is also fair as it rectifies some grave concerns from other egalitarian theorists. If one remains problematic of this principle is that of practical problems, namely, the way in which we can fund the EA’; then, I think, EA’ should be held as the ultimate goal  of educational development. </p>
