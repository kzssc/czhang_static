<li>Where are you now?		Barcelona, Spain</li>
<li>What are you doing in BCN?		Second half of my double Master’s.</li>
<li>What then, after the double Master’s?		I’m currently applying for my PhD, I hope to go back to the UK, or perhaps stay in Europe. If all things failed, I shall go back to China (and see if I can hack into any university).</li>
<li>Do you like Spain or the UK?		Big question. Buy me a drink (not merely a beer) and I will tell you.</li>
<li>Do you miss the UK?		Yes.</li>
<li>Do you miss China?		Yes.</li>
<li>What do you do in your leisure time?		Define leisure.</li>
<li>Ok, but apart from philosophising, what do you do?		Erm. Not-philosophising? But this itself is a way of philosophising. We might want to be more specific about what we mean by philosophising.</li>
<li>What music do you listen to?		I do cheesy pop (more english than Chinese) &#8211; judge away, some instrumental jazz, some classical.</li>
<li>Favourite TV show?		Favourite is a strong word.</li>
<li>Ok what TV show do you watch now?		Currently on top of my head: Mozart in the Jungle<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, GoT S7, How to Get Away with Murders, Grand Tour, Various Panel / Non-Panel shows in the UK, 	Madam Secretary, Scandal, Uehiro Lectures (I know.)</li>
<li>Your presentations are so cool, what do you use?		Keynote.</li>
<li>But my keynote doesn’t do the same as yours…		Upgrade it.</li>
<li>What’s the best way to reach me?		iMessage and Email.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I can help you (to the best of my ability) to get access to political philosophy books. </strong></p>
<p>Couple caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes books are not free, I will have to pay some money too. I don’t mind paying for you first, but you have to pay me back later. Trust is important.</li>
<li>I don’t make money on this.</li>
<li>You can use it for journal articles unless you cannot get it using 1) university log-in; 2) sci-hub. (If I get access using either of this method you’ll be banned for good).</li>
<li>I will get you the PDF of the book (no hard-copy what-not).</li>
<li>Turnaround is normally 24 hour, but I make no promise.</li>
<li>You can submit in but, but one-book-per-line, please.</li>
<li>Format: Book name (space) author (e.g., Morality of Freedom Joseph Raz)</li>

<li>Where did the MUN section on your website go?		As I am no longer active in MUN (not sure if that’s “retirement”), MUN seizes to be a big part of my life. Archive posts, however can still be accessed here: <a href="www.vpchris.com/mun">vpchris.com/mun</a></li>
<li>What about your edited Rules and Procedures?		Still available (though I have not update it at all), just drop me a line. But there is no reason why you should rely on my RoP as there are so many great and updated RoPs out there!</li>
<li>Can I still invite you to a conference?		<strong>Sure</strong>, but make sure it’s a good one.</li>
<li>Can I see your MUN CV?		<a href="https://sishengzhang.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sisheng-Chris-Zhang-MUN-Resume.pdf">Here</a></li>
<li>Should I go into MUN?		Perhaps a bit biased: definitely.</li>
<li>But my english is bad, I’m not sure.		Tough luck that you’re reading this.</li>
<li>But I don’t want a political career.		Yeah sure all MUNers ended up being presidents for their countries. (Not)</li>
<li>Should I represent my own country?		No.</li>
</ol>
