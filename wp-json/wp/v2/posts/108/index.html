Finally, I shall show how the <em>shareholder<\/em> differs from conventional entitlement theory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introduction<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many find intuitive that the current generation (e.g., we) have obligations toward future generations. However, theories such as the non-identity (NID) wields away much force in transcribing our moral intuition into obligations. For Parfit, NID says there is no promise that this agent (to whom we owe our obligations) will <em>necessarily<\/em> exist<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1<\/a><\/sup><sup><a id=\"ffn2\" href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnote\">2<\/a><\/sup>; therefore, we cannot identify, exactly, to whom we owe our obligations. Joseph Mazor responses to NID. His theoretical foundation is what we might call a \u201c<em>chain<\/em>\u201d: <em>briefly<\/em>, that 1) an immediate future generation <em>necessarily<\/em> overlaps with its current generation along with 2) our obligations toward all currently existing people mean that the obligations owed to any future generation can be traced back to generations prior to it. Put differently, take three generation proceeding: A-B-C (earliest-latest, while A and C do not overlap), A owes obligations toward C because A owes obligations to B, and B to C; also because A necessarily overlaps with B, and B with C. One might, therefore, argue that Mazor\u2019s theory overcomes the NID for A\u2019s obligations toward C does not require the existence of any particular member of C to come into existence. I believe this is mistaken but can be dealt with. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>This essay replies to Mazor\u2019s proposal by offering a remedial approach to his theoretical foundation: shareholder. <em>Shareholder<\/em> says that for <em>any<\/em> individual claim to particular resource, it is possible <em>if and only if<\/em> there exists no further active competition to particular resource. I believe, <em>shareholder<\/em> conjoins with Mazor\u2019s chain model is a highly plausible theory for intergenerational justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are four sections in this essay. Firstly, I highlight how, exactly, is NID challenging for intergenerational theorists. Secondly, I debunk Mazor\u2019s argument and show how the NID remains unchallenged, while the problem of contingency emerges. Thirdly, I layout the <em>shareholder<\/em> approach. Finally, I reply to challenges. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Parfit\u2019s Non-Identity Problem<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following Parfit, I assume that future generation necessarily exists<sup><a id=\"ffn3\" href=\"#fn3\" class=\"footnote\">3<\/a><\/sup>, meaning that the NID is a <em>real<\/em> problem<sup><a id=\"ffn4\" href=\"#fn4\" class=\"footnote\">4<\/a><\/sup>. Unable to determine the identity of the future people means that their claims to resources are hardly weighty to guide existing people\u2019s actions. To be sure, it is <em>not<\/em> that we cannot benefit people in the future; but that we cannot benefit any <em>particular<\/em> future person. More importantly, it is also possible to deny responsibilities for future people, in light of NID<sup><a id=\"ffn5\" href=\"#fn5\" class=\"footnote\">5<\/a><\/sup><sup><a id=\"ffn6\" href=\"#fn6\" class=\"footnote\">6<\/a><\/sup>. Collectivising the claims of future generation<sup><a id=\"ffn7\" href=\"#fn7\" class=\"footnote\">7<\/a><\/sup> is also disputable for Mazor<sup><a id=\"ffn8\" href=\"#fn8\" class=\"footnote\">8<\/a><\/sup>. Intergenerational justice, therefore, ought to bind individuals rather than a generation. Finally, justice derived from people\u2019s entitlement and rights are also problematic. Parfit believes that future people, once they exist, can reasonably reject what we have assume of the them. We assume that a premature mother\u2019s child is necessarily worse-off, but this need not be what this child, <em>in fact<\/em>, concedes.<sup><a id=\"ffn9\" href=\"#fn9\" class=\"footnote\">9<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Mazor\u2019s Chain<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mazor\u2019s argument proceeds in two steps: 1) equal-share-transfer obligation, then 2) generations have obligations to conserve resource for future generation. In this section, I will sketch Mazor\u2019s argument before exposing its problems, these will cast lights onto theoretical improvements. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>For Mazor, equal-share-transfer obligation says that once a person exists, all other existing people have a justice-based obligation to ensure that he receives an equal share of resources; such is a claim of entitlement. Mazor argues that one\u2019s resource-entitlement is unaffected even when 1) a certain type of resource is depleted or 2) there is no unoccupied resource. Responding to NID, Mazor argues that people \u201c<em>are being harmed once they exist by not being given equivalent resources.<\/em>\u201d<sup><a id=\"ffn10\" href=\"#fn10\" class=\"footnote\">10<\/a><\/sup>. He concedes that while, pre-existence, one cannot be harmed due to NID; but he is harmed if he does not receive equal resources once he come into existence. Put simply, NID tackles on <em>potential<\/em> harm, and Mazor dodges the NID as he charges on <em>current<\/em> harm<sup><a id=\"ffn11\" href=\"#fn11\" class=\"footnote\">11<\/a><\/sup>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Building on the equal-share-transfer obligation, the resource-conservation obligation, for Mazor, can be sufficiently grounded as a demand of justice, rather than mere obligation. When <em>Agnes<\/em> (in the current generation) fails to save sufficient resources for the future generation, <em>Anthony<\/em> (same generation as Agnes) ought to be held accountable. Importantly<sup><a id=\"ffn12\" href=\"#fn12\" class=\"footnote\">12<\/a><\/sup>, that people co-exist in a generation means that they form a partnership in meeting the resource requirement of future generation; and when one refuses to comply (e.g., Agnes), this means that those who comply ought to bear more burden<sup><a id=\"ffn13\" href=\"#fn13\" class=\"footnote\">13<\/a><\/sup>. To be sure, Agnes owes her obligations <em>not<\/em> toward future generation but simply to complying people in the current generation (e.g., Anthony) as their obligations are otherwise less burdensome to uphold had everyone complied<sup><a id=\"ffn14\" href=\"#fn14\" class=\"footnote\">14<\/a><\/sup>. While it can be argued that the additional burden due to no direct fault of Anthony\u2019s is too demanding for him<sup><a id=\"ffn15\" href=\"#fn15\" class=\"footnote\">15<\/a><\/sup>, he is, nonetheless, <em>residually liable<\/em> for not being able to prevent the injustice from happening in the first place (e.g., of Agnes\u2019s overconsumption)<sup><a id=\"ffn16\" href=\"#fn16\" class=\"footnote\">16<\/a><\/sup><sup><a id=\"ffn17\" href=\"#fn17\" class=\"footnote\">17<\/a><\/sup>. Thus, all are liable for under-providing resources for future generations once they exist. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>I believe Mazor\u2019s argument is persuasive to bind non-complying agents to certain valuable obligations (e.g., of conserving resources) even if one does not act in light of justice for future generations. However, even if Agnes eventually complies with the obligations toward Anthony, for me, she does so for the wrong reason. Agnes, unlike Anthony, is acting disingenuously towards future generation. Anthony\u2019s ingenuous care for the future generation persuade him to pick up Agnes\u2019s slack. Sure, slack-picking, say, when one is unaware of his obligations, is in many cases <em>helpful<\/em>. But it seems highly counterintuitive to claim that <em>every<\/em> slack-picking is equally morally weighty. Pushing other\u2019s chair into a table when he has forgotten to do so in a cafe <em>might<\/em> help with conserving resources for future generation. Imagine that we have helped David who assigns much importance to chair-pushing, that, when he knows of the accident (of not having to pushed the chair in), he <em>drives<\/em> back so that he can push back his chair. Therefore, we help reducing his petrol consumption by helping with his chair-pushing. But this case may seem farfetched for intergenerational justice because our kind chair-pushing is not, primarily, due to our concern for the future generation; instead, we concern primarily with elements proximate to us (e.g., David). Even if our action, by chance, helps with a greater goal (e.g., welfare of future generation), it seems presumptuous to equate such action to one that has more direct bearing on the greater goal.<sup><a id=\"ffn18\" href=\"#fn18\" class=\"footnote\">18<\/a><\/sup> I shall call this the <em>contingency<\/em> problem. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Motivating the <em>Shareholder<\/em> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus far, we see Mazor\u2019s proposal dodges NID, and that the contingency problem is real. I believe that the <em>shareholder<\/em> approach can remedy both problems. Further, as we shall see, the <em>shareholder<\/em> does not require one\u2019s entitlement or rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Being a <em>shareholder<\/em> of resources means that <em>one acknowledges that he is only able to obtain particular resource due to the lack of additional competition that could otherwise exist<\/em> (e.g., due to new-borns). A miner is only possible to extract particular units of coal at a given time and space, <em>if and only if<\/em>, there exist no other miners mining this identical portion of coal. To be sure, <em>shareholder<\/em> differs from mere acquisition\/consumption (that resource-consumption, entail a reduction in total available resource for others); but that it also charges on the idea that someone else will make use of the identical share of resources<sup><a id=\"ffn19\" href=\"#fn19\" class=\"footnote\">19<\/a><\/sup>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, <em>shareholder<\/em> replies to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>NID: that we have obligations to future generations <em>not<\/em> because of their entitlement to a certain\/equal share of resources (whether they in fact exist or not); instead, it is because of the lack of competition that can otherwise make impossible for one to extract the particular portion of resources. Future person\u2019s identity, therefore, is irrelevant for <em>shareholder<\/em>.<br><\/li>\n\t<li>Contingency: acknowledging the chances in which we may be impossible to extract a particular resource means that the claim to resource-entitlement is groundless<sup><a id=\"ffn20\" href=\"#fn20\" class=\"footnote\">20<\/a><\/sup>. <em>Shareholder<\/em> entails that our actions, <em>necessarily<\/em>, bear on the otherwise competing agents, whether they exist or not. <br><\/li>\n\t<li>Entitlement\/rights: that one <em>can<\/em> utilise particular resource is because his competitors have not done so; and nothing about this begs one\u2019s entitlement\/right. Competitors need not <em>necessarily<\/em> compete for the <em>this<\/em> particular resource, but the total supply of this resource: one\u2019s extraction of coal depends on coal being available (free from <em>direct<\/em> competition); if total supply of coal reduces dramatically, then, competitors <em>will<\/em> <sup><a id=\"ffn21\" href=\"#fn21\" class=\"footnote\">21<\/a><\/sup>directly compete. Individuals have reasons not to over-consume for his prospect, in light of future competition to be  as low as possible. <br><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <em>shareholder<\/em>, <em>per se<\/em>, might be under-demanding to be action-guiding because it relies heavily on personal perceptions which are highly individualised: that one sees a fierce resource-competition does not make it true for other people. However, <em>reasonable<\/em> people should not find it difficult that if all over-consumes, not only it is more difficult for themselves to consume more in the future (as resource becomes more scarce); but also that they <em>mutually<\/em> deprive each others\u2019 possibility of resource-consumption, yielding hostility between people, obstructing social cooperation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Coda<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In liberal societies, one can reasonably reject social cooperation temporarily. However, a complete rejection seems impossible, more so with increased competition (e.g., due to emerging future generation). What we learn from Mazor\u2019s chain is that intergenerational justice obligations can be met even if other co-existing members do not comply. <em>Shareholder<\/em> overcomes both NID and contingency problem for people now have obligations not only towards themselves but also members that could constitute their competition. More importantly, the existence and the identity of such members are trivial for the <em>shareholder<\/em> approach, as long as we can envisage the future generation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<h1>Bibilography<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Kumar, Rahul. 2003. \u201cWho Can Be Wronged?.\u201d Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs 31(2): 99\u2013118.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Mazor, Joseph. 2010. \u201cLiberal Justice, Future People, and Natural Resource Conservation.\u201d Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs 38(4): 380\u2013408.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Murphy, Liam B. 2003.
